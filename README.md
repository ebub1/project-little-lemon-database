# project-little-lemon-database
The capstone project involved creating a comprehensive database and client solution for a restaraunt called Little Lemon. The project aimed to address various aspects of the company's operations like database modeling, optimizing queries, data analytics. 

Module 1. 

In the first module, I created a local git repository to track and manage my project's changes. I then linked it with a remote GitHub repository. Using MySQL Workbench, I set up the MySQL instance server. To design the database structure, I created an Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram. This diagram represented the entities, their attributes, and the relationships between them. After finalizing the ER diagram, I implemented it in MySQL and populated the necessary tables using Python on Jupyter IDE.

Module 2: 

In this module I aimed to use my knowledge SQL to accomplish two main objectives: adding sales reports and implementing a table booking system. Here's an overview of the tasks I performed:
Adding sales reports:
1. To summarize data efficiently, I created a virtual table using SQL JOIN operations. This virtual table allowed me to consolidate and present relevant information from multiple tables.
2. To manage and analyze the data effectively, I developed optimized queries using stored procedures and prepared statements. These queries optimized performance and enhanced the overall efficiency of data retrieval and manipulation.
3. As I progressed through the module and made changes to the project, I consistently committed my work to the git repository. Committing the project involved saving the changes and recording them in the repository's history, ensuring a comprehensive version control system was in place.
Table booking system:
1. I created SQL queries to check for available bookings based on user input. These queries allowed the system to retrieve and display information about the availability of tables at a given date and time.
2. Additionally, I implemented SQL queries to add and update bookings in the system. These queries facilitated the creation of new bookings and the ability to modify existing bookings, ensuring accurate and up-to-date records.

Module 3:

In Module 3 I focused on two main tasks: data analytics and visualisation in Tableau and using database client.
Using Tableau, I designed and developed an interactive dashboard to visualize and analyze sales and profit data by client for the Little Lemon restaurant.

in second part of the module, to interact with the MySQL database, I set up the client project using the Python API MySQL Connector. Next, I implemented query functions to facilitate database interactions. These functions allowed me to perform common database operations such as querying for specific data, retrieving results. In order to present the results in a more user-friendly format, I utilized the Dataframe method from Pandas module.
